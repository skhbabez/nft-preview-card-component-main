## My process

### What I learned

I used this project to experiment with BEM CSS. I was surprised by how much my workflow simplified, due to BEM's structure. While I prefer approaches like CUBE CSS, I can see the value in BEM.

Codewise, I discovered relative colors, which is something I'll use more in the future.

```css
background: rgb(from var(--cyan-400) r g b / 50.3%);
```

### Continued development

I will probably look a little deeper into techniques like BEM or CUBE CSS in the future. While I will probably not use them in React projects, a lot of the concepts seem overall useful and worthwhile to add to my workflow.

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://cssguidelin.es/#bem-like-naming) - I used the official BEM documentation as a reference for this projects.
- [Relative Colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Relative_colors) - Good article on how to use relative colors in css.
